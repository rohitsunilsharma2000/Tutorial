# Describe and demonstrate how to create a Docker bridge network for developers to use for their containers.


Creating a **Docker bridge network** allows developers to set up an isolated network on a Docker host where containers can communicate with each other while being isolated from other networks, including external networks. This is commonly used for **local development environments** where containers need to interact with each other on the same host.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create and use a **Docker bridge network** for developers:

---

### **1. Create a Docker Bridge Network**

To create a custom bridge network, follow these steps:

1. **Open a terminal** on your Docker host.

2. **Create the bridge network** using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge-network
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `docker network create`: The command used to create a new Docker network.
     - `--driver bridge`: Specifies the use of the bridge driver, which creates an isolated internal network for containers on the same Docker host.
     - `my-bridge-network`: This is the name of your custom bridge network. You can replace it with any name you prefer.

   After running the command, Docker will create the bridge network, and you can start using it for your containers.

---

### **2. Verify the Network Creation**

To verify that your bridge network has been successfully created, use the following command:

```bash
docker network ls
```

This will list all the networks, and you should see `my-bridge-network` in the output, indicating that it was created successfully.

---

### **3. Connect Containers to the Bridge Network**

Now that you’ve created the bridge network, you can start containers and connect them to this network. For example, let’s run two containers and connect them to the `my-bridge-network`.

1. **Run the first container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name container1 --network my-bridge-network nginx
   ```

   - This command runs a container named `container1` from the `nginx` image and connects it to the `my-bridge-network` network.

2. **Run the second container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name container2 --network my-bridge-network nginx
   ```

   - This command runs another container named `container2` from the `nginx` image and also connects it to the same bridge network.

---

### **4. Verify Container Connectivity**

Once both containers are running on the same bridge network, you can check that they can communicate with each other.

1. **Access container1**:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it container1 bash
   ```

2. **Ping container2 from container1**:

   Inside `container1`, run the following command to ping `container2`:

   ```bash
   ping container2
   ```

   You should see successful ping responses, which means the two containers are able to communicate with each other over the bridge network.

---

### **5. Expose Containers to the Host Machine**

If you want to expose certain ports of the containers to the host machine (for instance, for accessing a web application running inside a container), you can use the `-p` flag when running the container.

For example, to expose port `80` from the container to the host’s port `8080`:

```bash
docker run -d --name container1 --network my-bridge-network -p 8080:80 nginx
```

- This will allow you to access the web server running inside `container1` by visiting `http://<host_ip>:8080` on your browser.

---

### **6. Remove the Network (Optional)**

If you no longer need the network and want to remove it, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker network rm my-bridge-network
```

This will remove the custom bridge network, but the containers connected to it will still function. If you want to clean up containers as well, use `docker rm` to remove them.

---

### **Summary**

- **Step 1**: Create a custom bridge network using `docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge-network`.
- **Step 2**: Verify the network creation with `docker network ls`.
- **Step 3**: Run containers and connect them to the bridge network using `--network my-bridge-network`.
- **Step 4**: Verify container connectivity using `docker exec` and `ping`.
- **Step 5**: Expose container ports to the host machine if needed using the `-p` flag.
- **Step 6**: Optionally, remove the network with `docker network rm`.

This setup is ideal for developers working with **multiple containers** on the same host that need to communicate with each other securely and in isolation.
