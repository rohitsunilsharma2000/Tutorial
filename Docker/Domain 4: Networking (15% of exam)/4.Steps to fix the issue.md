The warning you're seeing indicates that the `version` attribute in your `docker-compose.yml` file is no longer required, and Docker Compose will ignore it. However, the main issue seems to be the **connection timeout** error related to the logging driver.

The error message `failed to initialize logging driver: Options "http://localhost:8088/services/collector/event/1.0": dial tcp [::1]:8088: connect: connection timed out` suggests that Docker is trying to use a logging driver (like the `fluentd` driver) configured to send logs to `localhost:8088`, but it is unable to connect to that service.

### **Steps to fix the issue:**

1. **Check for Default Logging Driver Configurations:**
   It’s possible that the Docker Engine or the Docker Compose configuration is set to use a logging driver that is not properly set up (in this case, it seems to be `fluentd` or a similar one). You can check and reset the logging driver to the default one (`json-file`) to avoid this issue.

   - Open Docker’s daemon configuration (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and ensure the default logging driver is set to `json-file`.

   Here’s how you can modify it (if it's not already set):

   ```json
   {
     "log-driver": "json-file"
   }
   ```

   After making this change, restart the Docker daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

2. **Override Logging Driver in `docker-compose.yml`:**
   If you want to avoid the default logging driver issue and specify the logging driver per container, you can modify your `docker-compose.yml` file to explicitly set the logging driver for your services. Add the `logging` option to your containers like this:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     web1:
       image: nginx
       container_name: container1
       networks:
         - my_bridge_network
       logging:
         driver: "json-file"

     web2:
       image: nginx
       container_name: container2
       networks:
         - my_bridge_network
       logging:
         driver: "json-file"

   networks:
     my_bridge_network:
       driver: bridge
   ```

   This will explicitly set the logging driver to `json-file` for both containers, which is the default and does not require an external service.

3. **Remove Existing Containers and Restart:**
   If the issue persists, remove the existing containers and start fresh:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will tear down the existing containers and networks, and then start new ones with the updated configurations.

---

### **Summary**:
1. Remove or adjust the `version` field in the `docker-compose.yml` (it's no longer required).
2. Set the logging driver to `json-file` to avoid external logging dependencies.
3. Restart Docker or recreate the containers using `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up -d`.

This should resolve the connection timeout error related to the logging driver.
