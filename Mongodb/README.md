    Given a scenario where multiple documents need to be updated, identify the correct update expression.
    Given a findAndModify scenario where another operation is run concurrently, identify the output and how the database changed state.
    Given a scenario where a document should be deleted from the database, identify the delete expression that should be used.
    Given a scenario where a single document should be looked up by a simple equality constraint (e.g., {x: 3}), identify the expression that should be used.
    Identify documents matched by a query with an equality constraint on an array field.
    Identify documents matched by an expression with relational operators in it.

    Identify how to get all results from a cursor.
    Identify the expressions used to count the number of documents matching a query.

    Given an aggregation expression using $match, $group, identify the correct output.
    Given an aggregation expression using $lookup, identify the correct output.
    Given an aggregation expression using $out, identify the correct output.

Section 3: INDEXES (17%)

    Given a query that is performing a collection scan, identify which index would improve the performance of this query.
    Given a query that is performing a collection scan on an equality match on an array field, identify which index would improve the performance of this query.
    Given a query with no constraint and a sort of two fields that is doing a collection scan, identify which index would improve the performance of this query.
    Given a collection, identify how many indexes exist for that collection.
    Identify poor production practices.
    Identify the explain plan outputs that signify a potential performance issue, specifically whether an index is present or not for the given query.

Section 4: DATA MODELING (4%)

    Given a scenario with three collections (a parent and two children) and the user, identify the embedded relationships and which should be linked.
    Identify data model examples that are considered an anti-pattern.

Section 5: TOOLS AND TOOLING (2%)

    Given a scenario to load the Atlas Sample Dataset and then use Data Explorer to find a given first document in a collection.

Section 6: DRIVERS (18%)

    Define what the XX driver is.
    Define how the XX application connects/uses the XX driver.
    Define the components of the URI string used by MongoClient to connect the driver to the database.
    Identify what connection pooling is in terms of the driver and what advantages it offers.
    Identify the correct syntax for the XX driver to insert one document and to insert many documents.
    Identify the correct syntax for the XX driver to update one document and to update many documents.
    Identify the correct syntax for the XX driver to delete one document and to delete many documents.
    Identify the correct syntax for the XX driver to find many documents and to find one document.
    Identify the correct syntax for the XX driver to create an aggregation pipeline.
    Identify the different syntax for the XX driver when using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL) and when using the Aggregation Framework.
