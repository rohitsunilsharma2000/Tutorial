The error `bash: ping: command not found` occurs because the `ping` command is not available by default in some Docker images, such as the `nginx` image, which is a minimal image. You can install `ping` by installing the necessary tools within the container, or alternatively, you can use other methods to verify container connectivity.

### **Option 1: Install `ping` Command Inside the Container**

1. **Install `iputils-ping`** inside the `container1` (which uses the `nginx` image):

   Run the following commands to install the necessary tools:

   ```bash
   apt update
   apt install iputils-ping
   ```

2. After installation, you should be able to ping `container2` from `container1`:

   ```bash
   ping container2
   ```

### **Option 2: Use `curl` for Connectivity Testing**

If you prefer not to install additional packages in the container, you can use `curl` (if it's available) to test connectivity by accessing services running inside the containers.

1. **Access the container** and use `curl` to test if `container2` is reachable via HTTP (port 80 for example):

   ```bash
   curl container2
   ```

   If `container2` is running an HTTP server (like `nginx`), this will show the HTML output from `container2`.

2. **Install `curl` if necessary**:

   If `curl` is not installed in the container either, you can install it with:

   ```bash
   apt update
   apt install curl
   ```

### **Option 3: Use `docker exec` to Inspect IPs and Directly Ping by IP**

1. **Find the IP address of `container2`** by running:

   ```bash
   docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container2
   ```

   This will give you the IP address of `container2` within the Docker network.

2. **Ping by IP** from `container1`:

   ```bash
   ping <container2_ip>
   ```

   Replace `<container2_ip>` with the IP address you retrieved.

### **Option 4: Use `docker exec` with a Minimal Image to Test**

If you donâ€™t want to modify the existing containers, you can run a **minimal container** that includes `ping` for testing. For example, run a `busybox` container to test the ping:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --network my-bridge-network busybox ping container2
```

This will run a `busybox` container, use the same bridge network, and attempt to ping `container2`.

---

### **Summary**

- **Option 1**: Install `ping` inside the container using `apt install iputils-ping`.
- **Option 2**: Use `curl` to check HTTP-based connectivity between containers.
- **Option 3**: Use container IPs directly to test connectivity.
- **Option 4**: Use a minimal `busybox` container for quick testing.
