Job Description:
We are looking for an experienced Cloud DevOps Engineer to deploy and manage our Dash-based web application in a scalable, secure production environment. This deployment will facilitate seamless API interactions, automated updates, and high-performance monitoring.
We have a Dockerized Dash app that has been tested locally using Docker Desktop and needs to be deployed to a cloud platform (Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud) with best practices for security, scalability, and performance.
Responsibilities:
âœ… Deploy the Dash app in a scalable production environment.
âœ… Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle security, load balancing, and SSL (HTTPS), happy to discuss.
âœ… Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments and updates from our GitHub repository.
âœ… Configure infrastructure monitoring to ensure high performance, uptime, and alerts for potential issues.
âœ… Ensure API interactions work seamlessly and are secured.
âœ… Optimize the cloud setup to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently.
âœ… Set up automated backups for disaster recovery.
âœ… Document the entire deployment process so that we can manage and scale it in the future.

âœ” CI/CD pipeline integrated for continuous deployment from GitHub
âœ” Nginx configured for security, load balancing, and SSL setup
âœ” Monitoring tools set up to track performance and uptime

Additional information:
- Subdomain will be provided from my hosting website in Hostinger. The freelancer will need to configure DNS settings and integrate it with the cloud deployment.
- There is no database implemented yet in the code, but there is the need to access ,csv and creating folder.
- The deployment must support future integration of a database, most probably PostgreSQL.
- The infrastructure must be scalable, allowing for future upgrades in memory, processing power, and speed as needed.
- The cloud setup should enable seamless scaling based on traffic demands (e.g., using auto-scaling and load balancing).
- Application Stack: The Dash app is built with Flask and should be optimized for production deployment with Gunicorn, Nginx, and Docker.
We are at the early stages of the project, and Azure or AWS is a bit above our budget.
