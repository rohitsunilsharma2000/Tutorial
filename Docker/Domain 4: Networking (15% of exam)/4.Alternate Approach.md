Certainly! Here's an **alternate approach** to creating and using a **Docker bridge network** for developers, using a **Docker Compose** setup. This is especially useful when you need to manage multiple containers in a development environment and want to easily configure and link them using a simple configuration file.

---

### **1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**

**Docker Compose** is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a single YAML configuration file. This approach simplifies the process of defining networks, containers, and how they interact with each other.

1. **Create a directory** for your project (if you don't already have one).

   ```bash
   mkdir my-docker-network
   cd my-docker-network
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** in this directory with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   
   services:
     web1:
       image: nginx
       container_name: container1
       networks:
         - my_bridge_network
   
     web2:
       image: nginx
       container_name: container2
       networks:
         - my_bridge_network

   networks:
     my_bridge_network:
       driver: bridge
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - **version**: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
     - **services**: Defines the containers you want to run (`web1` and `web2`).
     - **networks**: Both `web1` and `web2` are connected to a custom network named `my_bridge_network`.
     - **driver: bridge**: Specifies that the network should use the bridge driver (the default Docker network driver for local container-to-container communication).

---

### **2. Start the Containers Using Docker Compose**

Once you have the `docker-compose.yml` file, use the following command to start the containers defined in the file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `up`: Tells Docker Compose to start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode, so they run in the background.

---

### **3. Verify Network and Containers**

1. **Check the running containers**:

   Use the following command to see that both containers (`container1` and `container2`) are running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   You should see both `container1` and `container2` running, and they should be attached to the `my_bridge_network`.

2. **Inspect the network**:

   To verify the network, use:

   ```bash
   docker network inspect my-docker-network_my_bridge_network
   ```

   This will show details about the `my_bridge_network` and confirm that the containers are connected to it.

---

### **4. Verify Container Connectivity**

Now, you can test if the containers can communicate with each other:

1. **Access `container1`**:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it container1 bash
   ```

2. **Ping `container2` from `container1`**:

   Inside `container1`, run the following command to ping `container2`:

   ```bash
   ping container2
   ```

   You should see successful ping responses, confirming that both containers are able to communicate with each other on the same bridge network.

---

### **5. Expose Ports (Optional)**

If you want to expose ports for the containers to interact with the outside world (e.g., for web applications), modify the `docker-compose.yml` to include a `ports` section for each service.

```yaml
services:
  web1:
    image: nginx
    container_name: container1
    networks:
      - my_bridge_network
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Exposes port 80 of the container to port 8080 on the host

  web2:
    image: nginx
    container_name: container2
    networks:
      - my_bridge_network
    ports:
      - "8081:80"  # Exposes port 80 of the container to port 8081 on the host
```

After modifying the file, restart the services with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you can access `container1` via `http://localhost:8080` and `container2` via `http://localhost:8081`.

---

### **6. Clean Up**

Once you're done, you can stop and remove the containers with:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers as well as the network defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

---

### **Summary of Steps**:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** that defines services (containers) and networks.
2. **Start the containers** using `docker-compose up -d`.
3. **Verify that containers are running** and connected to the bridge network.
4. **Test container-to-container communication** using ping or other commands.
5. **Optionally expose container ports** to the host machine for external access.
6. **Stop and clean up** using `docker-compose down`.

This approach simplifies container management by using Docker Compose, allowing developers to manage multi-container setups and networks with ease, without manually running multiple `docker` commands.
