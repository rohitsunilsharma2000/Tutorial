## Job Description

We are seeking an experienced **Cloud DevOps Engineer** to deploy and manage our **Dash-based web application** in a scalable, secure production environment. This deployment will facilitate seamless API interactions, automated updates, and high-performance monitoring. The application is currently Dockerized and has been tested locally using Docker Desktop. The goal is to deploy it to a cloud platform (Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud) following best practices for **security, scalability, and performance**.

## Responsibilities

- âœ… **Deploy the Dash app** in a scalable production environment.
- âœ… Set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to handle security, load balancing, and SSL (HTTPS).
- âœ… Implement a **CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments and updates from our GitHub repository.
- âœ… Configure **infrastructure monitoring** to ensure high performance, uptime, and alerts for potential issues.
- âœ… Ensure **API interactions** work seamlessly and are secured.
- âœ… Optimize the cloud setup to handle **multiple concurrent users** efficiently.
- âœ… Set up **automated backups** for disaster recovery.
- âœ… **Document** the entire deployment process so that we can manage and scale it in the future.

## Additional Information

- A **subdomain** will be provided from our hosting website (Hostinger). The freelancer will need to configure DNS settings and integrate it with the cloud deployment.
- There is **no database** implemented yet in the code, but there is a need to access `.csv` files and create folders.
- The deployment must support **future integration of a database**, most probably **PostgreSQL**.
- The infrastructure must be **scalable**, allowing for future upgrades in memory, processing power, and speed as needed.
- The cloud setup should enable **seamless scaling** based on traffic demands (e.g., using auto-scaling and load balancing).
- **Application Stack**: The Dash app is built with **Flask** and should be optimized for production deployment with **Gunicorn, Nginx, and Docker**.
- We are at the **early stages of the project**, and **Azure or AWS** is currently above our budget. Cost-effective solutions are preferred.

---

## Application Stack

- **Dash** (Python framework for web applications).
- **Flask** (backend framework).
- **Docker** (containerization).
- **Nginx** (reverse proxy and load balancing).
- **Gunicorn** (WSGI server for production).
- **PostgreSQL** (future database integration).
- **CI/CD Tools** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD).
- **Cloud Platform** (Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud).

## Notes for Freelancers

- The project is in its **early stages**, so flexibility and cost-effective solutions are highly valued.
- Documentation is critical to ensure the team can manage and scale the deployment in the future.
- If you have experience with **budget-friendly cloud solutions** or alternative platforms, feel free to propose them.
